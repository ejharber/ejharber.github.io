## Objective
My research pursuits thus far have revolved around three key concepts: tactile sensing, deformable object modeling, and motion planning. The primary goal of my Ph.D. is to integrate these ideas to improve the dynamic control of deformable objects, particularly by incorporating feedback from tactile sensors to gain a more nuanced understanding of the internal state of these objects. Through this approach, my aim is to illustrate that by leveraging both visual and force feedback, we can successfully bridge the Sim2Real gap in the manipulation of deformable objects.
