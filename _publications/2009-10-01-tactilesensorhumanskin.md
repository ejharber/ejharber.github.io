This conference abstract presents research on developing an affordable tactile sensor system that emulates the sophisticated sensing capabilities of human skin. The work addresses a critical need in biomedical engineering and robotics for accessible, high-performance tactile sensing solutions.

**Bio-Inspired Design Philosophy:**
The sensor design draws direct inspiration from the multi-layered structure and diverse mechanoreceptor distribution found in human skin. By mimicking the biological architecture that enables humans to perceive pressure, texture, temperature, and vibration, the research aims to create synthetic tactile systems with comparable sensitivity and versatility.

**Cost-Accessibility Focus:**
A key innovation of this work is the emphasis on low-cost manufacturing and materials, making advanced tactile sensing technology accessible for:
- **Educational Applications**: Enabling hands-on learning in biomedical engineering programs
- **Research Democratization**: Allowing smaller research groups to explore tactile sensing applications
- **Clinical Prototyping**: Supporting rapid development of biomedical devices
- **Assistive Technologies**: Making tactile feedback systems more affordable for prosthetics and rehabilitation devices

**Technical Approach:**
The sensor system integrates multiple sensing modalities within a skin-like flexible substrate, potentially incorporating:
- Pressure-sensitive elements mimicking Pacinian and Ruffini corpuscles
- Surface texture detection capabilities similar to Meissner corpuscles
- Multi-layered sensing architecture reflecting the epidermis-dermis structure of biological skin

**Biomedical Engineering Applications:**
The research has significant implications for biomedical applications including:
- **Prosthetic Devices**: Providing tactile feedback for amputees
- **Surgical Robotics**: Enabling minimally invasive procedures with tactile sensation
- **Rehabilitation Technology**: Supporting sensory retraining and therapy
- **Human-Machine Interfaces**: Improving interaction between users and medical devices

**Interdisciplinary Collaboration:**
This work represents collaboration between biomedical engineers, roboticists, and materials scientists at Carnegie Mellon University, combining expertise in biomimetics, sensor design, and biomedical applications.

The focus on affordability and accessibility could democratize advanced tactile sensing technology, enabling broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications where cost has traditionally been a barrier to implementation. -->
